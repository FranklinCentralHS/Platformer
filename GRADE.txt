Notes:

Feature branches weren't merged into main, so I checked them individually
* Flying ememy
-doesn't fly, just a different speed compared to the normal enemy
* Sprint
-doesn't look like any inputs were added or checked, so not sure what was added
* Camera thats moves on it's own
-I see the camera mover scene and script, but it doesn't look like it is used anywhere
