## Reflections

Payton M. - Accidently did the doublejump code on a new script instead of the already existing one.
Owen W. - I felt that I could've done better on this project. I felt like I made the changes well it just took a lot of time and I could have done it more efficiently. More of my time would've been saved by not making silly spelling errors that took awhile to figure out.
Logan S. - I feel like I could've been more efficient, The change I originally wanted to make took up too much time and didn't even work so I had to start a new change from scratch.
